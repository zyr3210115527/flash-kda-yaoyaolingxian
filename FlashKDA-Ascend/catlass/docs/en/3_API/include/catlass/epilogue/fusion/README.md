# Epilogue/Fusion Templates Overview

`Fusion` is the directory where the graph orchestrator and node layers of EVG are implemented. The actual code is located in:

- `include/catlass/epilogue/fusion/fusion.hpp`
- `include/catlass/epilogue/fusion/*.hpp`

This document serves only as a directory index. Node parameters, `Arguments` structures, common operators, and sample indices are centrally located in [evg_api](../../../../evg_api.md).

## File Responsibilities

| Component                 | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fusion.hpp`              | Main entry header file, which directly includes common graph orchestrators and nodes.    |
| `tree_visitor.hpp`        | Organization logic for `TreeVisitor`.                                                    |
| `topological_visitor.hpp` | Organization logic for `TopologicalVisitor`.                                             |
| `VisitorImplBase`         | Aggregates `Arguments`, `Params`, workspace calculations, and feasibility checks.        |
| `VisitorImpl`             | Constructs callbacks in a unified manner and provides a general framework for all nodes. |
| `visitor_*.hpp`           | Specific node implementation.                                                            |
| `operations.hpp`          | Operator encapsulation used by `VisitorCompute`.                                         |
| `visitor_impl_base.hpp`   | Definitions for `VisitStage` and the core basic framework.                               |
